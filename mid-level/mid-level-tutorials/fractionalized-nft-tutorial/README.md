# ðŸª™ Fractionalized NFT Tutorial

Hello there, in this tutorial we will show you the necessary steps on how to fractionalize an NFT. Letâ€™s look at the requirements for doing it.

* Original NFT should be locked in a contract. The idea here is when you create fractions, it should be limited. It has no point for an investor if infinitely new fractions minting/increasing the supply would be possible because that would make your share reduced each time.&#x20;
* NFT owners should be able to lock their assets and will get semi-fungible tokens in&#x20;
