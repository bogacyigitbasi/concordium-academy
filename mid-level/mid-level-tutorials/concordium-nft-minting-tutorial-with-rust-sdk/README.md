# ‚õè Concordium NFT Minting Tutorial with Rust-SDK

Hey there, in this tutorial we are going to interact with a CIS-2 token contract for minting an NFT using the [Concordium Rust-SDK](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-sdk). We will deploy and initialize the contract using the SDK and similarly invoke functions like _mint()_, _transfer(),_ and _tokenMetadata()_ using it. Since this is an SDK-oriented tutorial, there will not be any specific explanation about smart contract development. You can find many other examples that show how you can interact with Concordium using the Rust-SDK in [this](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-sdk/tree/main/examples) example GitHub repository. We will use the [**Concordium Smart Contracts VSCode Extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Concordium.concordium-smart-contracts) to create our template contract.&#x20;
