# NFT Minting with ID 2.0

In this tutorial, we will show you how to create a minting platform that allows minting for people older than 18. In order to do that, the platform should ask for proof that the minter meets our requirement which is being older than 18 years old. We decided to create three parts:&#x20;

The first part includes a lot of cryptographic implementation and an explanation of the backend verifier.

The second part is about the front-end development and Concordium communication using concordium-web-sdk including web wallet integration.

And the last part is demonstration of the application including how it works.
