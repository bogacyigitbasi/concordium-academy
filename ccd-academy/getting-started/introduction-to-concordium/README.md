# Introduction to Concordium

## Our Vision

{% hint style="info" %}
Concordium emphasizes true trust in this disrupting technology through the ID Layer.
{% endhint %}

The Concordium blockchain is a compliance-ready blockchain backed by science that enables private and public transactions. It offers high throughput, fast transactions, and predictable fees, allowing businesses, developers, and traders to harness blockchainâ€™s true power and potential.

The protocol level ID ensures that every wallet is associated with a real-world identity that has been verified through a third-party ID provider so that people and companies can trust one another, while remaining private, with zero-knowledge proof.
