# ðŸª™ CIS-2 Token Types

In this section, you will learn more about Concordium Interoperability Standard tokens. (CIS-2) Unlike some other Layer-1 token standards, CIS-2 represents more than one type of token with one standard including fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens, semi-fungible tokens, and soulbound tokens. You can read more information about the CIS-2 standard library at this [link](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/blob/main/concordium-cis2/src/lib.rs).

**Concordium Interoperability Standard (CIS-2)**

A standard interface for both fungible and non-fungible tokens is implemented in a smart contract. The interface provides functions for transferring token ownership, allowing other addresses to transfer tokens, and querying token balances, operators, and token metadata. It allows off-chain applications to track token balances and the location of token metadata using logged events.
