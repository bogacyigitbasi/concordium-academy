# SoulBound Tokens

A Soul Bound Token (SBT) is a special type of NFT that is publicly verifiable and represents an individual's credentials and affiliations. It is a unique, non-transferrable type of token created by an issuer. It could represent the authenticity of furniture, a graduation diploma or a certificate issued by a university, a subscription-based membership proof like a golf club, a level or profession about something for example an eSports game like League of Legends, etc.

Concordium's Web3 ID will be effectively combining SBTs and its ID Layer with Zero Knowledge Proofs.&#x20;
