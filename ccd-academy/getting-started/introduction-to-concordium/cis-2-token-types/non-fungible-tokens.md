# Non-Fungible Tokens

A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a special type of token that represents a digital or physical asset's ownership. An NFT can be an on-chain proof of artwork, a game asset, music, real estate, digital or physical any kind of data, documents, etc. Anything can become an NFT as the NFT itself holds a link to the asset data itself. &#x20;

One of the key drivers of this type of crypto asset is uniqueness. When you create an NFT you simply create a unique asset that is stored on-chain with a specific token ID on a contract. This is not possible for anyone else and your asset remains unique forever on-chain. This brings scarcity, and this is what artists need for their masterpieces.
