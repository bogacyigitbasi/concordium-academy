# ðŸ’ª Basic Smart Contract

Create a smart contract that mints a CIS-2 token, transfers, and burns it when invoked by the concordium-client. It should require 20 CCDs for each operation (invokes) as transaction fees and doesn't allow minting the same token ID twice.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
To be able to accept CCD, you have to add the `payable` attribute to the `#[receive]` macro.
{% endhint %}
